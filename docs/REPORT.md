# Player Re-Identification System - Technical Report

## 📋 Executive Summary

This report documents the development of a real-time player re-identification system for sports video analysis. The system successfully processes a 15-second football video, detecting players and maintaining consistent identities when players leave and re-enter the frame. The implementation achieves reliable player tracking with 105 re-identifications across 58 unique players.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Objective**: Given a 15-second video (15sec_input_720p.mp4), identify each player and ensure that players who go out of frame and reappear are assigned the same identity as before.

**Key Requirements**:
- Use provided YOLO model for player detection
- Assign consistent player IDs based on initial detection
- Maintain same ID when players re-enter the frame
- Simulate real-time re-identification and tracking

## 🛠️ Approach and Methodology

### 1. System Architecture

The solution follows a modular architecture with three implementation levels:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Player Re-ID System                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Input Layer: 15sec_input_720p.mp4                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Detection Layer: YOLO Model (best (2).pt)                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Tracking Layer: Centroid-based Re-identification          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Visualization Layer: Bounding Boxes + ID Labels           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Output Layer: output_complete.mp4                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. Core Algorithm

**Re-identification Algorithm**:
```python
For each frame:
    1. Detect players using YOLO model
    2. Extract bounding boxes and centroids
    3. For each detected player:
        a. Calculate distance to existing trackers
        b. If distance < threshold (50px): Re-identify
        c. Else: Assign new ID
    4. Update tracker history
    5. Draw visualizations
```
